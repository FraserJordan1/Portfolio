                                I am a Computer Engineer based out in the rainy state of Seattle, WA. 
                                I have always been fascinated with Computers and circuitry, ever since I was a child. 
                                I would ponder on how it all worked and how the hardware would communicate with one another 
                                and how it would even know what do. This led me to pursue a career in Computer Engineering. 
                                I live my childhood dream everyday, learning new things everyday. 
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Although my profession is in Computer Engineering, I am not limited to it. 
                                I also posses experience and knowledge in other fields of Software Development such as, 
                                UI/UX Design, Cloud Computing, Web Development, Game Development, 2D Digital Art, and many more!
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                My love for engineering is clear, but I do have a life outside of it.
                                Another loved activity of mine is Swimming. It is my prefferred physical activity and I 
                                enjoy every minute of it even swimming professional for WA State back in High School. Nowadays, 
                                I only do it for fun and exercise and donâ€™t plan on letting up anytime soon.
